The Countercurse Mantra is a passive item available for both Detectives and Traitors. It will prevent the wearer from having their role swapped by the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2535321538]Cursed[/URL] role. It will also provide the wearer with 15 armor (configurable).
 
The wearer may still become Cursed through other means (ex. an Amnesiac wearing the Countercurse Mantra will still become Cursed if they look at a Cursed corpse).
 
Cursed players will be informed that their targets were "protected from curses".
 
Consider adding this item to the Survivalist's shop, so that a Traitor who is questioned by an inquisitve Cursed player can more effectively lie to them.
